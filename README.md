# Learning C

Learn C by pairing (mostly remotely) with an experienced C programmer.

Stated long term goal: to become fluent and confident in C, in order to
be interested, willing, and able to hack the perl core.

# Roadmap

A combination of pairing sessions, code reviews, home work, transmission.

## Pairing projects

* [Hello, World!](00-hello/) (0)
* Implement a [hashtable](01-hashtable/) from scratch (1)
* Turn the hashtable into a library (2)
* Implement a double-ended linked list with which you can "push, pop,
  shift, and unshift" items.
* Write a library providing the hashtable and double-ended linked list
* Write a custom allocator
* Bind to a C library using XS

## Homework projects (to review)

* Solve the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C

## Learning tools on the way

* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
* [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual.html)
* [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html)
