# Learning C

Learn C by pairing (mostly remotely) with an experienced C programmer.

Stated long term goal: to become fluent and confident in C, in order to
be interested, willing, and able to hack the perl core.

# Roadmap

A combination of pairing sessions, code reviews, home work, transmission.

## Pairing projects

* Implement a hashtable from scratch
* Implement a double-ended linked list with which you can "push, pop,
  shift, and unshift" items.
* Write a custom allocator
* Bind to a C library using XS

## Homework projects (to review)

* Solve the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C

## Learning tools on the way

* make
* valgrind

## Books

* *[21st Century C](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/21st-century-c/9781491904428/)*, Ben Klemens
* *Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries*, Don Libes
